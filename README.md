This repository contains data, R scripts and associated outputs, and other materials necessary for the Swan River First Nation camera project and manuscript - TBD

### GENERAL INFORMATION

**Project Information**   
This research was conceived by members of Swan River First Nation (SRFN) as part of their priorities for understanding wildlife and landscape change within their traditional territory. Data collection and image tagging were carried out by SRFN staff, with non-Indigenous collaborators contributing expertise in data analysis and statistical interpretation. Elders and knowledge holders were consulted to integrate Indigenous perspectives on mammal ecology and habitat change throughout the study. The project reflects an Indigenous-led, co-produced approach grounded in respect and reciprocity. Details on the study design of this project can be found in the Materials and Methods section of the associated manuscript - TBD
